NeoSphere enables users to:
1. Join or create "Spheres" (topic branches or communities).
2. Participate in events (both online and in-person).
3. Search for and complete jobs (freelance, hourly, or task-based).
4. Engage in discussions within Spheres.
5. Earn and use Karma Points (a built-in currency for platform activities).

  - Host discussions (forums, Q&A, or live chats).
  - Allow searching within the Sphere for workers, events, or discussions.

### 2. **Core Hub**
